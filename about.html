<h2>About this Blog</h2>
<p>It's just getting started and I'm hoping to have at least one post a week. I imagine it will be busier at the start but aim for one post each week on Saturday.  </p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I've been a professional QA for over tens years and doing QA Volunteer work for longer. I got my toes wet with Popcap Games and fell in love with testing. I keep reading QA blogs and they all seem to be either way below me or way above me. Thus to fill in the middle ground, I've started a blog with encouragement from my advocate.</p>
